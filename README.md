# NEAR NFT-Tutorial

Welcome to NEAR's NFT tutorial, where we will help you parse the details around NEAR's [NEP-171 standard](https://nomicon.io/Standards/NonFungibleToken/Core.html) (Non-Fungible Token Standard), and show you how to build your own NFT smart contract from the ground up, improving your understanding about the NFT standard along the way.

## Prerequisites

## Tutorial Stages

Each branch you will find in this repo corresponds to various stages of this tutorial with a partially completed contract at each stage. You are welcome to start from any stage you want to learn the most about.

| 1.skeleton    | [Contract Architecture](https://docs.near.org/docs/tutorials/contracts/nfts/skeleton) | You'll learn the basic architecture of the NFT smart contract, and you'll compile this skeleton code with the Rust toolchain.                                                                                                                           |
| 2.minting     | [Minting](https://docs.near.org/docs/tutorials/contracts/nfts/minting)                | Here you'll flesh out the skeleton so the smart contract can mint a non-fungible token                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 3.enumeration | [Enumeration](https://docs.near.org/docs/tutorials/contracts/nfts/enumeration)        | Here you'll find different enumeration methods that can be used to return the smart contract's states.                                                                                                                                                  |
| 4.core        | [Core](https://docs.near.org/docs/tutorials/contracts/nfts/core)                      | In this tutorial you'll extend the NFT contract using the core standard, which will allow you to transfer non-fungible tokens.                                                                                                                          |
| 5.approval    | [Approval](https://docs.near.org/docs/tutorials/contracts/nfts/approvals)             | Here you'll expand the contract allowing other accounts to transfer NFTs on your behalf.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 6.royalty     | [Royalty](https://docs.near.org/docs/tutorials/contracts/nfts/royalty)                | Here you'll add the ability for non-fungible tokens to have royalties. This will allow people to get a percentage of the purchase price when an NFT is purchased.                                                                                       |

The tutorial series also contains a very helpful section on [**Upgrading Smart Contracts**](https://docs.near.org/docs/tutorials/contracts/nfts/upgrade-contract). Definitely go and check it out as this is a common pain point.

# Quick-Start

If you want to see the full completed contract go ahead and clone and build this repo using

```=bash
git clone https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial.git
cd nft-tutorial
git switch 6.royalty
yarn build
```

Now that you've cloned and built the contract we can try a few things.

## On-Chain Simulation Tests

Tests are in `onchain_tests` and use [near-workspaces-ava](https://github.com/near/workspaces-js/tree/main/packages/ava): delightful, deterministic local testing for NEAR smart contracts.

If running on an M1 Mac, you will need to run `yarn arch` to switch to an x86 terminal before running tests or installing node packages.

## Mint An NFT

Once you've created your near wallet go ahead and login to your wallet with your cli and follow the on-screen prompts

```=bash
near login
```

Once your logged in you have to deploy the contract. Make a subaccount with the name of your choosing

```=bash
near create-account nft-example.your-account.testnet --masterAccount your-account.testnet --initialBalance 10
```

After you've created your sub account deploy the contract to that sub account, set this variable to your sub account name

```=bash
NFT_CONTRACT_ID=nft-example.your-account.testnet

MAIN_ACCOUNT=your-account.testnet
```

Verify your new variable has the correct value

```=bash
echo $NFT_CONTRACT_ID

echo $MAIN_ACCOUNT
```

### Deploy Your Contract

```=bash
near deploy --accountId $NFT_CONTRACT_ID --wasmFile out/main.wasm
```

### Initialize Your Contract

```=bash
near call $NFT_CONTRACT_ID new_default_meta '{"owner_id": "'$NFT_CONTRACT_ID'"}' --accountId $NFT_CONTRACT_ID
```

### View Contracts Meta Data

```=bash
near view $NFT_CONTRACT_ID nft_metadata
```

### Minting Token

```bash=
near call $NFT_CONTRACT_ID nft_mint '{"token_id": "token-1", "metadata": {"title": "My Non Fungible Team Token", "description": "The Team Most Certainly Goes :)", "media": "https://bafybeiftczwrtyr3k7a2k4vutd3amkwsmaqyhrdzlhvpt33dyjivufqusq.ipfs.dweb.link/goteam-gif.gif"}, "receiver_id": "'$MAIN_ACCOUNT'"}' --accountId $MAIN_ACCOUNT --amount 0.1
```

After you've minted the token go to wallet.testnet.near.org to `your-account.testnet` and look in the collections tab and check out your new sample NFT!

## View NFT Information

After you've minted your NFT you can make a view call to get a response containing the `token_id` `owner_id` and the `metadata`

```bash=
near view $NFT_CONTRACT_ID nft_token '{"token_id": "token-1"}'
```

## Transfering NFTs

To transfer an NFT go ahead and make another [testnet wallet account](https://wallet.testnet.near.org).

Then run the following

```bash=
MAIN_ACCOUNT_2=your-second-wallet-account.testnet
```

Verify the correct variable names with this

```=bash
echo $NFT_CONTRACT_ID

echo $MAIN_ACCOUNT

echo $MAIN_ACCOUNT_2
```

To initiate the transfer..

```bash=
near call $NFT_CONTRACT_ID nft_transfer '{"receiver_id": "$MAIN_ACCOUNT_2", "token_id": "token-1", "memo": "Go Team :)"}' --accountId $MAIN_ACCOUNT --depositYocto 1
```

In this call you are depositing 1 yoctoNEAR for security and so that the user will be redirected to the NEAR wallet.

## Errata

Large Changes:

- **2022-02-12**: updated the enumeration methods `nft_tokens` and `nft_tokens_for_owner` to no longer use any `to_vector` operations to save GAS. In addition, the default limit was changed from 0 to 50. PR found [here](https://github.com/near-examples/nft-tutorial/pull/17).

Small Changes:

- **2022-02-22**: changed `token_id` parameter type in nft_payout from `String` to `TokenId` for consistency as per pythonicode's suggestion
