In this _Zero to Hero_ series, you'll find a set of tutorials that will cover every aspect of a non-fungible token (NFT) smart contract.
You'll start by minting an NFT using a pre-deployed contract and by the end you'll end up building a fully-fledged NFT smart contract that supports every extension.

---

## Prerequisites

To complete these tutorials successfully, you'll need:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [A Testnet wallet](https://testnet.mynearwallet.com/create)
- [NEAR-CLI](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli#installation)
- [cargo-near](https://github.com/near/cargo-near)
